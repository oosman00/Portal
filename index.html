       <p>Hello! my name is Osman Osman and I was born and raised in Seattle. I have experience in managing employees and optimizing workflow efficiency at a local transportation company. I’ve managed to decrease downtime by implementing an interface that the drivers would use to log their hours and show their route activity. I’m a 20-year-old software development student currently studying at Year Up, and my goal is to earn a computer science degree and work towards certificates to aid towards my goal of working at a reputable software company such as Microsoft and help manage teams. </p>
       
       <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdBSoy9F9NA" target="_blank">Here is one my favorite instrumental compilations</a> Whenever I listen to instrumentals, I feel like i can work much more efficiently  compared to when I'm listentning to regular music!</p>
       
       <p> <strong> Relevant skills include:
         System Maintenance • HTML • Business Communication
        • Hardware Troubleshooting/Diagnostics • CSS • Program Management
        • Microsoft Office Suite • JavaScript • MacOS and Windows OS
      </strong>
          </p>
       
       <p> In the next 5 years, I hope to be wokring full time as software dev hopefully in seattle.  </p>
           
      <p>When I was 13, I was passionate about computers and computer science. My first step I took was building a PC part by part. This helped me understand the anatomy of a computer and how the parts work in conjunction with each other. I've learned many technical skills on the hardware aspect and it caused me to be more interested on the software side leading me to join the Year Up program.</p>
